    <p>«Когда в литературе есть Толстой, то легко и приятно быть литератором, так как Толстой делает за всех. Его деятельность служит оправданием тех упований и чаяний, какие на литературу возлагаются, < > пока он жив, дурные вкусы в литературе, всякое пошлячество, < > озлобленные самолюбия будут далеко в тени. Только один его нравственный авторитет способен держать на известной высоте так называемые литературные течения и настроения».
    А.П. Чехов</p>
